# My Next.js Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with **create-next-app**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** and components from **shadcn/ui**.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework with hybrid static & server rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautifully designed components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Customization

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load **Geist**, a modern font family from Vercel.

To customize the UI components, modify the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js` and the shadcn components as needed.
